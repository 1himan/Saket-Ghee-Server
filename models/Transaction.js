// This model will be used to track each order's payment details on our platform

// Why do you need it?
// Payment Tracking: It helps keep a record of every payment made by users for transparency.
// Error Handling: It tracks the status of transactions (Pending, Failed, or Success) to handle payment errors or delays.
// Integration with Payment Gateways: When using payment gateways like Razorpay, Stripe, or PayPal, each transaction generates a unique transaction_id for reference.
// Legal and Financial Reporting: The model ensures compliance with financial laws and generates data for accounting or audits.
// Example Use Case:
// A user purchases Ghee for â‚¹1000 using a credit card. The system creates a transaction with details like the payment method, amount, and status.
// If the payment fails, you can retry or show a message to the user.
